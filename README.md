# Swarm Intelligence Practice 
Welcome to the Swarm Intelligence Labs repository! This repository contains a collection of lab exercises, code samples, and documentation related to the study and application of swarm intelligence algorithms. Swarm intelligence is a subfield of artificial intelligence that involves the collective behavior of decentralized, self-organized systems, typically composed of simple agents.

## Algorithms
- Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)
- Firefly algorithm (FA)
- Genetic algorithm (GA)
- Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)
- Differential Evolution (DE)
- Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO)
